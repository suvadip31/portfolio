# Description
This project uses attributes of 19382 TikTok videos provided as a part of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate. The goal of the project is to build an efficient machine learning model that predicts 'Claim' / 'Opinion' classification of a TikTok video. On TikTok platform, users can report videos that vioaltes terms and service. Studies show that videos violating terms and service mainly contains 'Claims'. As a huge volume of videos are reported everyday, it's difficult to review every video by humans. Hence, a machine learning model that predicts if a video contains 'Claim' or 'Opinion' will help a lot.

Detail descriptions of the exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building and model evaluations are included in tiktok.ipynb file.
