# Description
This project uses attributes of 19382 TikTok videos provided as a part of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate. The goal of the project is to build an efficient machine learning model that predicts 'Claim' / 'Opinion' classification of a TikTok video. On TikTok platform, users can report videos that vioaltes terms and service. Studies show that videos violating terms and service mainly contains 'Claims'. As a huge volume of videos are reported everyday, it's difficult to review every video by humans. Hence, a machine learning model that predicts if a video contains 'Claim' or 'Opinion' will help a lot. Detailed descriptions of the exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building and model evaluations are included in tiktok.ipynb file.

### Summery
1. Built a machine learning model with data from $\sim 19,000$ TikTok videos that predicts whether it presented claims or opinions, to improve and accelerate human moderation process.
2. Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and EDA with NumPy, Pandas, and seaborn libraries, and identified key features in data.
3. Implemented Random Forest and gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithms, performed cross-validation and hyper-parameter tuning on both models, and compared their performances on validation dataset.
4. Applied the champion model on test data to identify key predictors, achieving 99% accuracy.
