### Description
This project uses cement product data to build an artificial neural network that predicts quality (strength) of the product. The data was provided by IBM as a part of the IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate.
Detailed descriptions of the exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building and model evaluations are included in the quality-prediction.ipynb file.

### Summary
1. Built an artificial neural network that predicts quality (strength) of a cement product.
2. Trained model, tested predictions against observations, and evaluated performance using appropriate metric.
3. Optimized the neural network and reshaped it's structure, improving it's efficiency by 44.9%.
