## Description

Investment in Stock market has utter importance in financial world, and plays a crucial role in modern economy. 
To faciliate proper invesments, it is extremely important to have an idea of changes in stock market prices, and hence, a machine learning model predicting market prices will be beneficial. 
Here I have used historical stock price data of Google Inc. to build a machine learning model that predicts stock prices efficiently. Data was retrieved from Yahoo! Finance.

## Summary

1. Built a machine learning model in Python that efficiently predicts market stock prices of Google Inc.
2. Implemented XGBoost algorithm and performed cross-validation to migitate overfitting.
3. Performed hyper-parameter tuning using GridSearchCV, improving its efficiency by 26.9%.
4. Deployed the trained model on test data, comapared the predictions with observations, and identified its key predictors.
