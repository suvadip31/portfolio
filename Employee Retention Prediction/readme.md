This project uses data of ~15,000 employees of Slaifort Motors (a fictional company) as a part of the capstone project of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Profesional Certificate. 
The goal of the project is to build an efficient machine learning model to predict employee retention. The company wants to identify key predictors to improve on, so that employees are comfortable working there. 
I have showcased a logistic regression , decision tree and XGBoost model and compared their performances. Detailed descriptions of the exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building and model evaluations are included in the employee-retention.ipynb file.
ML models are saved in .pkl files.

### Summery
1. Built machine learning models that predict employee turnover of Salifort Motors (a fictional company).
2. Performed data cleaning, EDA, and feature engineering with Python, and identified key features in data.
3. Implemented logistic regression, decision trees and XGBoost algorithms, and optimized via hyper-parameter tuning.
4. Compared their performances and identified the most important predictors.
