This project uses data of ~15,000 employees of Slaifort Motors (a fictional company) as a part of the capstone project of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Profesional Certificate. 
The goal of the project is to build an efficient machine learning model to predict employee retention. The company wants to identify key predictors to improve on, so that employees are comfortable working there.
I have showcased a logistic regression , decision tree and XGBoost model and compared their performances. Detail descriptions of the exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building and model evaluations are included in the employee-retention.ipynb file.
